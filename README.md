# lilarasp

lilarasp is a Python script running on a Raspberry Pi which checks if a
[lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) user is online. While the user is online
the led will be on.

# Motivation

The motivation behind this script is that the current World Chess Champion
([Magnus Carlsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen)) regularly
plays chess on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) and I keep missing watching
his games live. I hope from now and on I won't!

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.7
- Raspberry Pi (any version)
- 1 breadboard (optional but useful)
- 2 male to female jumper wires
- 1 led
- 1 resistor ([can be anything over about 50Î©](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing/2))
